Output Report

Step 5; Nonsensical, Unusual, or Incorrect outputs:

Issue 1:
    Inputs: 
    -How many people were surveyed? 100 
    -How many of them prefer basmati rice over jasmine rice? 50
    -How many of them prefer jasmine rice over basmati rice? 50
    Outputs:
    -50.0% prefer basmati rice over jasmine rice.
    -50.0% prefer jasmine rice over basmati rice.
    -More people prefer jasmine rice over basmati rice.
    Issue:
    Even though there is an equal proportion of people who prefer basmati and jasmine rice, the program outputs that jasmine rice is
    the favorite. It should say there is no clear favorite type of rice. This is caused by the conditional statements starting at 
    line 30 failing to account for equal odds. 
Issue 2:
    Inputs:
    -How many people were surveyed? 10 
    -How many of them prefer basmati rice over jasmine rice? 5
    -How many of them prefer jasmine rice over basmati rice? 6
    Outputs:
    -50.0% prefer basmati rice over jasmine rice.
    -60.0% prefer jasmine rice over basmati rice.
    -More people prefer jasmine rice over basmati rice.
    Issue:
    The number of votes for basmati and jasmine rice do note equal the input for the number of people surveyed. Because of this the 
    percentages are also wrong for percent of people who prefer each type of rice. This is caused by using numberSurveyed as the
    divisor in the percentage calculations instead of the sum of basmati and jasmine rice voters. (preferBasmati + preferJasmine) 
Issue 3:
    Inputs:
    -How many people were surveyed? 10000
    -How many of them prefer basmati rice over jasmine rice? 95
    -How many of them prefer jasmine rice over basmati rice? 9905
    Outputs:
    -0.9% prefer basmati rice over jasmine rice.
    -99.0% prefer jasmine rice over basmati rice.
    -More people prefer jasmine rice over basmati rice.
    Issue:
    Because the code limits the specificity of the percentages, there is a precision error on the voting percents and the 
    percentages do not add to 100%. It seems this error is caused by line 24, which truncates the double rather than rounding.

                                                    -Negative votes
                                                    -0 surveyed Nan
                                                    -int overflow error for votes

Step 6:
Logic Error Explanation:
    In logic_error.cpp I swapped the > sign on line 30 with a < sign. This causes the program to output the incorrect favorite
    type of rice. In the example below, 7 voters prefer jasmine and 3 prefer basmati rice, but the code incorrectly outputs
    basmati rice to be the favorite. 
    Example: 
        Inputs:
        -How many people were surveyed? 10
        -How many of them prefer basmati rice over jasmine rice? 3
        -How many of them prefer jasmine rice over basmati rice? 7
        Outputs:
        -30.0% prefer basmati rice over jasmine rice.
        -70.0% prefer jasmine rice over basmati rice.
        -More people prefer basmati rice over jasmine rice.
Step 7:
Error 1:
    Explanation: 
        I removed line 5 which said using namespace std; Because of this every instance we used cout, endl or cin failed to compile.
        Apart from replacing the deleted line, this could be fixed by typing std:: before each instance of cout, endl or cin. It
        also caused line 22 to have an error because ios::fixed uses namespace std as well. Fixed version would be std::ios::fixed
    Output Message:
        use of undeclared identifier 'cout'; did you mean 'std::cout'?
            cout << "How many people were surveyed? ";
Error 2:
    Explanation:
        On line 26 I swapped one of the insertion operators (<<) with an extraction operator (>>) causing the cout line to not compile. 
    Error Message:
        invalid operands to binary expression ('std::ostream' (aka 'basic_ostream<char>') and 'double')
            cout >> pctBasmati << "% prefer basmati rice over jasmine rice." << endl;
